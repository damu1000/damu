<!--
list all input parameters inside <input> tag. 

Valid elemtents:
Mandetory:
int patch_size: patch size
int xpatches: number of patches in x dimension
int ypatches: number of patches in y dimension
int zpatches: number of patches in z dimension

Optional:
int verify: 0 or 1: verify answers if set to 1. Default 0 

## following are used only by hypre_cpu_ep.cc to virtually arrange threads in 3dimension and distribute patches accordingly.
e.g. consider 3d grid of 4x4x1 patches. for threads 2x2x1 and 4 ranks, rank 0 will get patches 0, 1, 4, 5

int xthreads: number of threads in x dimension (threads will be arranged in 3d grid)
int ythreads: number of threads in y dimension (threads will be arranged in 3d grid)
int zthreads: number of threads in z dimension (threads will be arranged in 3d grid)

xthreads * ythreads * zthreads will override OMP_NUM_THREADS
To get simple hardcoded mapping similar to the one used in hypre_cpu.cc, set xthreads=#threads, ythreads=1 and zthreads=1
